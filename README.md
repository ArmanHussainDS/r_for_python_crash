# r_for_python_crash

An afternoon crash course on R, RStudio, and the tidyverse.

## Contents

This is a repo in development that was initially developed as an afternoon crash course for students at [Flatiron School]() to learn the basics of [R](), [RStudio](), and the [tidyverse] in an afternoon.
The contents assume both familiarity with intermediate level programming in Python as well as familiarity with basic statistical and machine learning topics.
Many materials are drawn from previous workshop materials that can be found [here]().
