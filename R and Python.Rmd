## Intergration

One of the coolest things about some of the latest RStudio versions is the intergration between R and Python.

For example, you can not only run some Python in RStudio as you can see from the `example.py` script.
You can also run both R and Python in the same RMarkdown document! 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

dog_table <- tibble(
  names = c("dengue", "dolce", "murray", "dog_a", "dog_b", "dog_c"),
  ages = c(5, 8, 5, 4, 6, 7)
)

dog_table %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = names, y = ages)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")


```



```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
# Set plot space as inline for inline plots display

# an example of a bar plot 
ax = plt.subplot() # create an axis object, which the plot object which we can customize
our_dogs = ["dengue", "dolce", "murray", "dog_a", "dog_b", "dog_c"] 
dogs_age =  [5, 8, 5, 4, 6, 7]

plt.bar(range(len(our_dogs)), dogs_age)

ax.set_xticks(range(0,len(our_dogs))) # set ticks values, as a method of the axes
ax.set_xticklabels(our_dogs) # set tick labels, also as a method of the axes

plt.title('Age of Random Dogs')
plt.xlabel('Dogs')
plt.ylabel('Age')
plt.show()
```
